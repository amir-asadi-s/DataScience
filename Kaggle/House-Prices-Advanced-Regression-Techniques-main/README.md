# Home Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using various regression models. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [source](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains the R scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Contains the saved models (if any).
- `results/`: Contains the output files such as plots or final reports.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used during the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `LICENSE`: Information about the project's license.

## Installation
install.packages(c("caret", "glmnet", "randomForest", "gbm", "xgboost"))

## Usage
Running the Analysis

To run the complete analysis, you can execute the main R script:

Rscript scripts/main_analysis.R

## Predicting House Prices

After training the models, you can predict house prices using the saved models. Load a model from the models/ directory and apply it to new data:

# Example of loading and using a model

preprocess data
use the blueprint
load model
predicted_prices <- predict(final_model, newdata = test_data)

## Results

The project compares multiple models based on various metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that the Ridge Regression model performs the best overall, especially for homes under $300,000.

## Key Findings:

- Regularization methods (particularly Ridge regression) offered the best balance of bias and variance, making it the   most robust model regarding error metrics.
- Decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting also showed strong performance,          particularly in capturing non-linear relationships.
- Linear regression, while simpler, struggled with higher-priced homes due to its sensitivity to outliers.

## Deployment

To deploy this model for real-world use, consider the following:

- Accuracy: Ensure that professionals handle the data collection process to maintain high accuracy.
- Completeness: Verify that datasets are complete and up-to-date.
- Sample Size: To improve model performance, consider expanding the dataset, particularly for higher-priced homes.
- Base Price Adjustment: Incorporate inflation or market trends to adjust price predictions.
- Continuous Improvement: Regularly update the model based on new data and feedback.

## Challenges

The most significant challenge during this project was the extensive data understanding and preparation required. With many features, careful consideration was needed to ensure the dataset was clean and relevant, accounting for around 90% of the project's time.
