# Home Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using various regression models. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [source](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains the R scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Contains the saved models (if any).
- `results/`: Contains the output files such as plots or final reports.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used during the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `LICENSE`: Information about the project's license.

## Installation
```R
install.packages(c("caret", "glmnet", "randomForest", "gbm", "xgboost"))
```

## Usage
Running the Analysis

To run the complete analysis, you can execute the main R script:
```bash
Rscript scripts/main_analysis.R
```

## Predicting House Prices

After training the models, you can predict house prices using the saved models. Load a model from the `models/` directory and apply it to new data:

### Example of loading and using a model
```R
# Preprocess data
# Use the blueprint
load(model)
predicted_prices <- predict(final_model, newdata = test_data)
```

## Results

The project compares multiple models based on various metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). After evaluating several models, the **XGBReg** model was found to be the best-performing model.

### Best Model: **XGBReg**
XGBReg outperformed other models based on the following criteria:
- Lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Median Absolute Error.
- Smallest Standard Deviation of Errors, indicating consistent performance.
- Relatively low Maximum Error, reducing the risk of large prediction errors.

## Key Findings:

- **XGBReg** emerged as the most robust model based on all error metrics. It provides the best balance between prediction accuracy and consistency across the entire price range.
- Other models like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest also showed strong performance, but **XGBReg** offered the most consistent results with minimal error variation.
- Linear models, including Ridge Regression, performed reasonably well but struggled with capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

## Deployment

To deploy this model for real-world use, consider the following:

- **Accuracy**: Ensure that professionals handle the data collection process to maintain high accuracy.
- **Completeness**: Verify that datasets are complete and up-to-date.
- **Sample Size**: To improve model performance, consider expanding the dataset, particularly for higher-priced homes.
- **Base Price Adjustment**: Incorporate inflation or market trends to adjust price predictions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the model based on new data and feedback.

## Challenges

The most significant challenge during this project was the extensive data understanding and preparation required. With many features, careful consideration was needed to ensure the dataset was clean and relevant, accounting for around 90% of the project's time.
