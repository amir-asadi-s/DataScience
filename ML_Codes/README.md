# Machine Learning Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains Python code for various machine learning algorithms. The purpose is to provide a foundation and reference point for further exploration and development in this field.

- **supervised_learning**: Code for supervised learning algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
- **unsupervised_learning**: Code for unsupervised learning algorithms like K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), etc.
- **reinforcement_learning**: Code for reinforcement learning algorithms (if applicable).
- **deep_learning**: Code for deep learning models (if applicable), potentially further subdivided by architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN).
- **utils**: Utility functions used across multiple algorithms (data loading, preprocessing, evaluation metrics).

  
I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new algorithms to share, please consider creating a pull request.
